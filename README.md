# Testing a perceptual phenomenon
## The Stroop Effect

This project is part of Udacity's Nanodegree Program.

In a Stroop task, participants are presented with two list of words, with each word displayed in a color of ink. The time it takes to go through both lists is recorded.<br>
In the congruent words condition, the words being displayed are color words whose names match the colors in which they are printed: for example RED, BLUE.<br>
In the incongruent words condition, the words displayed are color words whose names do not match the colors in which they are printed: for example PURPLE, ORANGE.<br>

The project contains the Jupyter Notebook where the analysis was performed, as well as the original data provided by Udacity.
